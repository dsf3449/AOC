# Advent of Code
The repo where I keep my answers and records of the Advent of Code challenge that happens every year!

You can sign up to participate in the Advent of Code on their website, https://adventofcode.com.

And if you are a fan of MatPat and the theory trio - please join [the Official Game Theorists Discord](https://discord.gg/s8y9GYF), where you can find a custom leaderboard for Advent of Code!
